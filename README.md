## Description

description:

-   I created three separate components for each level.
-   I tried to split the solution as much as possible with smart and dumb components.
    Such as the components (action-button / input / list)

-   I created an angular.module.ts file for all calls to Angular Material.
-   I added an interceptor with error handling in case of internet outage.
-   I used Jest for unit testing.
-   I used Cypress for all e2e.

for the rest, I let you discover, ah ah ah!
